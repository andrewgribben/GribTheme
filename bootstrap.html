					<p>Let me start with a question, do businesses care more about disability than the Church? Perhaps some do, but it‚Äôs much more likely that many adaptations are made due to obligations and carefully planned and costed strategy.</p>
					<p>Should the church follow suit? Does it already? Some churches operate as a business, with a large staff and budget who can be fully aware of and actively pursue accessibility compliance, so what sets them apart from companies like Coca Cola, or Apple?</p>
					<p>One of the things I‚Äôve learnt, especially in the last few years, has been the importance of empathy. This Christ-like heart is the one great advantage that the Church has over the world.</p>
					<p>When it comes to adapting to disability, <strong>businesses have regulations, but families have needs</strong>. We certainly weren‚Äôt prepared for a child with special needs; we had to adapt quickly and still are. We had to learn fast, change on the fly and learn not be disappointed when things inevitably didn‚Äôt go to plan. Sometimes we might learn from the example of others, other times it‚Äôs Petey himself who teaches us, like when he sat on stage for 45 minutes at his nursery school nativity and took part in every song.</p>
					<p>Families have needs. What is the Church if not a family?</p>
					<p>Just as we weren‚Äôt prepared, it‚Äôs ok that the Church isn‚Äôt either.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>If you don‚Äôt have have congregants in wheelchairs then there‚Äôs no need to put an ugly wheelchair ramp out front?</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<p>If no one in your church suffers from epilepsy, are strobe lights and laser shows during worship fine?</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>These statements might be true for you and that‚Äôs ok! The important thing is that we are aware of others, sensitive of their needs and have empathy with them.</p>
					<p>While it‚Äôs easy to think that we don‚Äôt have congregants with a specific need and therefore don‚Äôt need to make adaptations, chances are we don‚Äôt have those people because they‚Äôve went elsewhere, or worse, nowhere.</p>
					<p>More than anything the Church needs to reveal the Father‚Äôs heart to the community; it‚Äôs ok to not be prepared as long as we have love. We‚Äôve already talked about how difficult it is for us and for other families of children with special needs, to do something new. Almost a year go we came here, to morning service backed up by nothing but Google and prayer and were welcomed and loved immediately. We didn‚Äôt judge the church because they didn‚Äôt meet every single of of Petey‚Äôs needs, because how could they prepare for a child they‚Äôd never met.</p>
					<p>That‚Äôs not to say that we‚Äôd just visit anywhere. What brought us to our current church was prayer and Google. We had to make a shortlist of churches that had certain facilities and at least one was dropped from the list for having no useful information on their website.</p>
					<p>I could talk for another hour about the importance of having a relevant church website but you‚Äôll be glad to know that now is not that time! A church website only can take you so far, to the door. What made us stay, even in the face of David McBride‚Äôs hugs, even when people didn‚Äôt completely understand, was that we felt accepted and loved.</p>
					<p><strong>What good is the great commission without love? If we go in obligation and not love, then what good can we do?</strong></p>
					<p>The Church is stronger as a family. As family we can adapt to changing needs through love and as a family we can bring the kingdom to <em>all</em> around us.</p>
